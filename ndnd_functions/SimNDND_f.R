# Computes the constraints, samples the flows and estimates the biomass at time step t+1
# Gives times series of biomass, flows and fishing mortality

  # 1. Initialization of the simulation -------------------------------------

  # NDND model is based on a random sampling of flows in a restricted range of possibilities
  # Range of possibilites restricted by constraints expressed as inequalities
  # Ax =< b
  # A is the set of constraints on the fluxes
  # b is the set of constraints set on biomasses
  # x is a matric of fluxes and sampled randomly
